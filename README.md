*Vehicle Combat Simulator:*

VCS is a simple application that allows you to compare the stats of 2 vehicles within the game Foxhole, and simulate the odds of one vehicle winning over the other in a head-on fight.
the way VCS that is by simulating 1000 fights of the given tanks, head on, at the given range and armor levels, and output the results. 
note that VCS does not take into account the maximum range of vehicles.

All stats are taken from the official wiki: https://foxhole.wiki.gg/wiki/Foxhole_Wiki.

to manually edit vehicle stats, or add vehicles of your own, simply edit the vehicle_stats.csv file in the same folder as the .EXE

*Features*

- Displays the stats of the selected vehicles
- displays the chance each vehicle has to pen the other vehicle (from the front) at the given armor level and range
- allows you to simulate 1000 head on fights between the 2 tanks in one go, and outputs the results.


to run the app simply download the zip releases, unzip it and run the .exe inside

the app should work on all platforms. This is my first time writing a program of any kind, and I have little coding experience, so don't take the results as facts.
